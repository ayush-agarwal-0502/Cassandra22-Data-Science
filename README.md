## The PS and the Solution :

For PS , refer to the Kaggle page whose link is given above . Roughly explaining , we were required to predict when an invoice would be paid back , in number of days , based on the data given to us .

For the explanation of out solution , best refer the slides , since it explains everything about how we solved , I'll add a few important and noteworthy slides in this readme too .
